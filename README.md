In our project, we utilized PyTorch to build a neural network for clothing image classification. We employed both binary and multi-class classification techniques to classify images of fashion items.

To begin, we imported the Fashion MNIST dataset and normalized the pixel values to optimize the performance of our model. We then split the data for our binary classification model and built a class for our dataset. We trained and tested our model using a validation group and evaluated the results. We also implemented techniques to avoid overfitting, such as displaying the results on plots.

In addition, we also performed multi-class classification by building three models. We trained and tested each model, and improved their performance by experimenting with different layers, optimizers, and loss functions. Eventually, we were able to identify the best model, and saved and loaded it to test its performance on a single sample.
